I have received the reviewer report(s) on your manuscript, "Analysis of the 2005-2015 Earthquake Sequence in Northern Iran Using the Visibility Graph Method", which you submitted to Pure and Applied Geophysics.

Based on the advice received, I will consider your paper for publication after moderate to major revision.  When preparing your revised manuscript I ask you to carefully consider the reviewer comments, which are attached, and submit a list of responses to them.

Dear Editor,

This is an interesting paper that applies a relatively new technique to the seismicity data in Northern Iran. The manuscript is well-written and would be a worthy contribution to the Pageoph journal. I have a few moderate-to-major concerns that I recommend to be addressed by the authors in a revised manuscript.
 
1. Please explain why you decluster the catalog and be more specific on the declustering method/declustering-parameters and the results of the declustering procedure. How many events are in the catalog before/after declustering?
2. In order to check how well the declustering method worked for the analyzed datasets, would be useful to show the earthquakes in a plot of longitude versus time.
3. I think would be interesting to check/discuss/compare the k-M slope and b-value relation for both the original and the declustered catalogs.
4. I would suggest to check the results for several magnitude thresholds above the completeness magnitude. Are the conclusions robust or do they depend on the chosen magnitude thresholds?
5. Would it be possible to calculate a correlation coefficient for the k-M slopes and the b-values in Figure 9 (middle plot)?
6. The authors use 20 events (in a moving window) for estimating the b-values and k-M slopes in Figure 9. I think this is an extremely small number and I am concerned about the reliability of the b-value estimates. At least for the areas of higher seismicity the authors should also present graphs obtained using a larger number of events per moving window.
7. The discussion of b-values in relation with larger earthquakes (page 10) in Figure 9 is unclear. From a quick visual inspection, I fail to see any distinct anomalies before larger (M > 5.0) events. I think that a lack of correlation should be also discussed in the manuscript, if true.

The authors present an analytical method to estimate statistical properties of earthquake catalogs and they apply their method in Iranian catalog. Although I find some promise in the method I suggest that more analysis is required for the study to be comprehensive. 

1) Declustering the earthquake catalog, especially using parameters derived for California seismicity under modest monitoring conditions only brings additional uncertainty in the analysis. I am not sure why the authors believe that they should declutter the catalog. They could report if they find any time variability of b-value before/after aftershock sequences. I would suggest not going ahead with declustering.
2) Uncertainty analysis for standard b-value estimation for sample population, magnitude correction
3) I find that Mc (magnitude of completeness) determination, should be done in a time-dependent manner since from the Fig. 5 it is obvious that monitoring conditions change.
4) How do the Authors account for Bam earthquake in 2003 that has aftershock in the early part of their catalog?
