\section{Tectonic seismic regions and seismicity parameters}

The Iranian plateau is located on the Himalayan-Alpine seismic belt. It has a long history of large magnitude ($M>7$) earthquakes that are well documented dating back to the eighth century. Based on seismicity parameters and the geologic provinces of the plateau, Iranian earthquakes have been categorized into various seismic zones, ranging from the definition of four to nine major seismic zones in the more traditional studies \citep[e.g.,][]{Stocklin1968,Takin1972,Berberian1976}, and up to twenty to twenty-three tectonic seismic regions in the most elaborate ones \citep[e.g.,][]{Nowroozi1976,Tavakoli1999}. \citet{Mirzaei1998},  dividing Iran into five tectonic regions, called Azerbaijan-Alborz, Kopeh-Dagh, Zagros, Central-East Iran, and Makran. Considering the division of  \citet{Mirzaei1998} as a reference,  \citet{Karimiparidari2013}  divided the Azerbaijan-Alborz tectonic seismic region into two regions, which are Azerbaijan and the Alborz Mountain Range (hereinafter, Alborz). Azerbaijan, Alborz, and Kopeh-Dagh tectonic seismic regions encompass most of northern Iran.  Fig.~\ref{fig:study_region} shows the study area and tectonic seismic regions.

The Alborz tectonic seismic region has active reverse faults, which are parallel to the northwest-trending structural gain of the Alborz Mountains belt. The North Tehran Thrust adds more complexity due to the presence of south-dipping reverse faults, which are in part blind, such as the Davudieh, Shian, and Bagh-E Feyz. The northwest continuation of the Alborz Mountains, known as the Rocks of the Talesh Mountains, have been thrust northeastward and eastward over rocks of the south Caspian depression  \citep{Berberian1999}.\\ 
The Tabriz region (located in the Azerbaijan tectonic seismic region) is in the Araxes structural block of northwestern Iran, southwest of the continuation of the western Alborz Mountains toward the Caucasus. The North Tabriz Fault (NTF) is a complex northwest-trending structure, which contains evidence observed on aerial photographs, and vertical displacement with the north side up, of right-lateral strike-slip displacement  \citep{Berberian1999}.

The main Kopeh-Dagh fault consists of several partly overlapping segments parallel to the overall  NW - SE  structure with step-overs. The regions of overlap are characterized by shorter south-dipping thrust faults, striking roughly E - W  \citep{Berberian2001}.  \citet{Trifonov1978} reported active displacement along the main Kopeh-Dagh fault for more than 500 km. Main fault lines and fault systems in the interest region is represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:faults}.

\subsection{Magnitude Conversion}

The catalog of recorded earthquakes from 2005-15, downloaded from IIEES, reported earthquakes based on different magnitude scales \citep{IIEES}. The  $M_L$,  $M_S$, and  $mb$  magnitudes were converted through conversion relationships, as defined in  \citet{Zare2014}. Some data were also recorded in  $M_D$  (duration magnitude). These data are reported by the International Seismological Centre (ISC).   \citet{Deniz2010}  developed a set of empirical equations to convert earthquake magnitudes from  $mb$,  $M_D$,  $M_L$, and  $M_S$  scales to  $M_W$  scale using the orthogonal regression procedure. They used data from different data centers, including the ISC, of earthquakes that occurred in Turkey. In this study, we use the conversion equation of  \citet{Deniz2010}  to convert  $M_D$  to  $M_W$. 

\subsection{Declustering} 

It is generally assumed that the seismicity of each tectonic seismic source follows a Poissonian occurrence process. Therefore, in order to accomplish this, we decluster the earthquake catalog. In compiling the catalog of events, foreshocks and aftershocks are removed using a declustering methodology  presented by \citet{Gardner1974}. Fig.~\ref{fig:seismicity}  shows the epicenter of declustered instrumental  earthquakes.

\subsection{Catalog Completeness}

Catalog completeness is an important factor in studying an earthquake sequence. This characteristic measured as the minimum magnitude of complete recording for earthquake catalog. The completeness magnitude $(M_c)$ is often determined using simple numerical analysis. Two common approaches are maximum curvature method (MAXC) and goodness-of-fit test (GFT)(see \citet{Wiemer2000}). We use the Goodness-of-fit test and compute $M_c$ for each region's catalog. According to the GFT method, a complete catalog should follow the Gutenberg-Richter power law distribution of magnitude. The steps for selecting the completeness magnitude for each catalog include: 1) calculating the a-  and  b-  value based on minimum magnitude; 2) generating  synthetic events based on the achieved value when the cumulative number of events obey the power law distribution; and 3) calculating goodness of fit for predicted and observed cumulative numbers for each magnitude bin  \citep{Wiemer2000}. We increase the minimum magnitude and repeat the process in order to calculate the goodness of fit for each magnitude.  \citet{Wiemer2000} assumed a goodness of fit of 90\% as a threshold to select the completeness of the catalog. However,  not all frequency-magnitude distributions reach the 90\% mark. Fig.~\ref{fig:completeness} shows the goodness-of-fit values for three tectonic seismic regions. For each tectonic seismic region, we select the magnitude corresponding to the highest goodness of fit or the first magnitude with the goodness of fit greater than 90\%.

The vertical dashed lines indicate the completeness magnitude of each tectonic seismic region.}

\end{figure} 

Based on the results represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:completeness}, we select the minimum magnitudes for complete recording,  $M_c$ , is 3.5, 2.6, and 2.6 for Azerbaijan, Alborz, and Kopeh Dagh, respectively. Fig.~\ref{fig:mag-time}  shows the magnitude time series of the declustered data for the three regions. Earthquakes with magnitude greater than the completeness magnitude are represented.
