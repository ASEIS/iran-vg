\section{Tectonic seismic regions and seismicity parameters}
\noindent
Iran is situated over Himalayan-Alpide seismic belt, which has frequently experienced strong shaking induced by earthquakes. Based on seismicity parameters, different tectonic seismic devisions have been defined for Iran.  Some studies defined more detailed division \citep{Nowroozi1976, Tavakoli1999}, and some of them defined one simplified province \citep{Stocklin1968, Takin1972, Berberian1976}. \citet{Mirzaei1998} divided Iran into five tectonic regions, including Azerbaijan-Alborz, Kopeh-Dagh, Zagros, Central-East Iran, and Makran. Considering \citet{Mirzaei1998} devision as a reference, \citet{Karimiparidari2013} divided the Azerbaijan-Alborz tectonic seismic region into two regions, which are Azerbaijan and Alborz Mountain Range (hereinafter, Alborz). Azerbaijan, Alborz and Kopeh-Dagh tectonic seismic regions encompass most of the northern Iran.  Fig.~\ref{fig:study_region} shows the study area and tectonic seismic regions. \\

\noindent
Alborz tectonic seismic region has active reverse faults, which are parallel to the northwest-trending structural gain of the Alborz Mountains belt. The North Tehran Thrust (NTT) adds more complexity due to the presence of south-dipping reverse faults, which are in part blind, such as the Davudieh, Shian, and Bagh-E Feyz.
The northwest continuation of the Alborz Mountains, known as the Rocks of the Talesh Mountains, have been thrust northeastward and eastward over rocks of the south Caspian depression \citep{Berberian1999}. 

\noindent
 The Tabriz region (located in Azerbaijan tectonic seismic region) is in the Araxes structural block of northwestern Iran, southwest of the continuation of the western Alborz Mountains towards the Caucasus. The North Tabriz Fault (NTF) is a complex northwest-trending structure, which contains evidence observed on aerial photographs, and vertical displacement with the north side up, of right-lateral strike-slip displacement \citep{Berberian1999}.
\noindent
The main Kopeh-Dagh fault consists of several partly overlapping segments parallel to the overall $NW - SE$ structure with step-overs. The regions of overlap are characterized by shorter south-dipping thrust faults striking about E - W \citep{Berberian2001}. \citet{Trifonov1978} reported active displacement along the main Kopeh-Dagh fault for more than 500 km. 

\subsection{Magnitude Conversion}
\noindent
The catalog of recorded earthquakes from 2005-2015, which is downloaded from IIEES, reported the earthquakes based on different magnitude scales \citep{IIEES}. We converted the $M_L$, $M_S$, and $mb$ magnitudes through conversion relationships which are defined in \citet{Zare2014}. There are also some of data recorded in $M_D$ (Duration magnitude). These data are reported by International Seismological Centre (ISC).  \citet{Deniz2010} developed a set of empirical equations to convert earthquake magnitudes from $mb$, $M_D$, $M_L$ and $M_S$ scales to $M_W$ scales using orthogonal regression procedure. They used data of earthquake that occurred in Turkey from different data centers including ISC. In this study we use the conversion equation of \citet{Deniz2010} to convert the $M_D$ to $M_W$. 

\subsection{Declustering}
\noindent
It is generally assumed that the seismicity of each tectonic seismic source follows a Poissonian occurrence process. Therefore, in order to accomplish this, we declustered the earthquake catalog. In compiling the catalog of events, foreshocks and aftershocks were removed using a declustering methodology \citet{Gardner1974}. Fig.~\ref{fig:seismicity} shows the epicenter of declustered instrumental  earthquakes.

\subsection{Catalog Completeness}
\noindent
Completeness of catalog is an important factor in studying the earthquake sequence.  In this study we used the Maximum curvature method (MAXC) \citep{Wiemer2000} to determine the completeness magnitude. According to MAXC method, a complete catalog should follow the Gutenberg-Richter power law distribution of magnitude. The steps for picking the completeness magnitude for each catalog include: 1) Calculating the $a-$ and $b-$ value based on the minimum magnitude, 2) generating  synthetic events based on the achieved value somehow the cumulative number of events obey the power law distribution, and 3) Calculating the goodness of fit for predicted and observed cumulative numbers for each magnitude bin \citep{Wiemer2000}. We increase the minimum magnitude and repeat the process in order to calculate the goodness of fit for each magnitude. \citet{Wiemer2000} assumed the goodness of fit of 90\% as a threshold to select completeness of the catalog. However,  not all frequency-magnitude distributions reach the 90\% mark. Fig.~\ref{fig:completeness} , shows the goodness of fit values for three tectonic seismic regions. For each tectonic seismic region, we pick the magnitude corresponding to the highest goodness of fit or the first magnitude with goodness of fit bigger than 90\%.

\noindent
In this study we assume the minimum magnitudes for complete recording, $M_C$, are 3.5, 2.6, and 2.6 for Azerbaijan, Alborz, and Kopeh Dagh, respectively. Fig.~\ref{fig:mag-time} shows the magnitude time series of the declustered data for the three regions. Earthquakes with magnitude bigger than completeness magnitude are represented.
