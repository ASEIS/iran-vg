\section{Results}
\noindent
We generated the visibility graph parameters for three tectonic seismic regions in northern Iran for the period from 2005 to 2015. Number of earthquakes in each catalog after declustering and the seismicity parameters are presented in Table.~\ref{tab:b_k_m_param}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:k_m_plot_m} shows the $k-M$ relationship for the study regions.  In general with increasing magnitude the connectivity degree increases which results in increasing the slope of the $k-M$ relationship.

\noindent
We compared the $k-M$ slope with the $b-value$ of the Gutenberg-Richter law in the whole catalog and also in the sliding windows in time. The $b-value$ is generated through the maximum likelihood estimation \citep{Aki1965}.

\begin{equation}
b = \frac{log_{10}(e) }{\overline{M} - M_{min}}  
\end{equation}
 
 \noindent
 where $\overline{M}$ is the average magnitude and $M_{min}$ is the minimum magnitude in the sample, which in this case is the completeness magnitude for each tectonic seismic zone. Number of sequences and threshold magnitudes are considerably different for all tectonic seismic zones. \citet{Telesca2013} studied the effect of the number of earthquakes in catalog on the $k-M$ slope. Comparing the result of Guerrero region with reduced random sequence, \citet{Telesca2013} found that the number of sequence doesn't affect the $k-M$ slope.  According to \citet{Telesca2012}, the threshold magnitude has a minor effect in the VG parameters. In order to analyze the sensitivity of the catalogs to the number of events and the threshold magnitude we randomly pick 200 sequence from the catalogs with various sequence size. The minimum size of random windows are 150 events (note that the number of events in each catalog, before removing the events with magnitude less than completeness magnitude, are 271, 1262, and 399 for Azerbaijan, Alborz, and Kopek Dagh regions, respectively) and the maximum size is the size of the whole catalog. For each randomly picked magnitude time series we estimate the $Mc$ and calculated the $k-M$ and $b-value$. Fig.~\ref{fig:random} shows the relationship between $k-M$ slope and $b-value$ of the randomly selected data and statistical parameters for variables. Although changing the number of events and the threshold magnitude are slightly changes the results, they are fairly well clustered for each tectonic seismic region.

 \noindent
The $k-M$ slope shows higher coefficient of variation. We may argue that the $k-M$ slope is much dependent to the window size and threshold magnitude than $a-$ and $b-value$, which suggest the idea that $k-M$ slope can better represent the dynamic characteristics of the magnitude-time series. 
 
 

 
 \noindent
 Fig.~\ref{fig:regression} shows the relationship between the $k-M$ slope for three tectonic seismic regions in north of Iran and two other studies of Mexican zones \citep{Telesca2013}, and Pannonia zones \citep{Telesca2014}. Adding the results of the current study into the results of two previous similar studies improves the regression factor (increase from R=0.95 to R=0.958) and empower the idea of universal character of the relationship between the $b-value$ and the $k-M$ slope as \citet{Telesca2014} concluded.

Fig.\ref{fig:tc}  shows the variation of the $k-M$ slope and $b-value$ with time. Having lower number of event, we used 20 events as a window length with shift of one event between two successive windows. There is a very good similarity between the $k-M$ slope and $b-value$ in all tectonic seismic regions. In general, In all regions the $b-value$ and $K-M$ slope considerably drop before big earthquakes. Dropping the $b-value$ before large earthquakes have been studied in many different region \citep[e.g.][]{Wyss2000,Wyss2006,Schorlemmer2005,Chan2012}

\noindent
\citet{Telesca2016} observed the decreasing of the $<Tc>$ before large earthquake of Western India earthquake sequence. Fig.~\ref{fig:tc} shows the time variation of $<Tc>$ in the study area. The decreasing of the $<Tc>$ for large earthquakes have been shown in the figure. \citet{Telesca2016} demonstrated that the decrement of $<Tc>$ before large earthquake are independent of window size and the threshold magnitude. The fluctuation of magnitude time series' topology properties (e.g. the $k-M$ slope and $<Tc>$) could be affected by the window size. Sharp changes in the VG parameters happens through small windows. Using higher number of samples in the window will reduce the temporal effects of small or moderate earthquakes and highlight the effects of big earthquakes, even though the behavior of the parameters in time and also before big earthquake are similar \citep{Telesca2016}. %In general, more number of samples in a window smooth the results and highlight the effect of events with big magnitudes.
